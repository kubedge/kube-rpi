# A scrape configuration for running Prometheus on a Kubernetes cluster.
# This uses separate scrape configs for cluster components (i.e. API server, node)
# and services to allow each to use different authentication configs.
#
# Kubernetes labels will be added as Prometheus labels on metrics via the
# `labelmap` relabeling action.
#
# If you are using Kubernetes 1.7.2 or earlier, please take note of the comments
# for the kubernetes-cadvisor job; you will need to edit or remove this job.

# Scrape config for API servers.
#
# Kubernetes exposes API servers as endpoints to the default/kubernetes
# service so this uses `endpoints` role and uses relabelling to only keep
# the endpoints associated with the default/kubernetes service using the
# default named port `https`. This works for single API server deployments as
# well as HA API server deployments.

# (those whose names begin with 'container_') have been removed from the
# Kubelet metrics endpoint.  This job scrapes the cAdvisor endpoint to
# retrieve those metrics.

# In Kubernetes 1.7.0-1.7.2, these metrics are only exposed on the cAdvisor
# HTTP endpoint; use "replacement: /api/v1/nodes/${1}:4194/proxy/metrics"

# the --cadvisor-port=0 Kubelet flag).

# This job is not necessary and should be removed in Kubernetes 1.6 and
# earlier versions, or it will cause the metrics to be scraped twice.
